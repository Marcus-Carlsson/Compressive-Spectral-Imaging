# Fast Matrix Inversion in Compressive Spectral Imaging based on a Tensorial Representation

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for the code associated with the following journal paper: []

## Implementation Details

The code includes two main Live Scripts:

1. **`proposed_method.mlx`:** This script contains the implementation of the proposed framework. Use this script to explore and utilize the features of the proposed method.
2. **`speed_comparison.mlx`:** This script facilitates a speed comparison, allowing you to assess the computational efficiency of the inversion process when compared to other methods.

## Usage

Follow these steps to effectively use the provided code:

1. Open and run `proposed_method.mlx` to see the proposed framework in action.
2. Execute `speed_comparison.mlx` to compare the speed of the inversion process against other methods.

Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code to suit your specific needs. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to the paper or reach out for assistance.
